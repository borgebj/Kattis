/**
 * Explanation:

 Convert 23/4 into a mixed fraction.

 1. First, divide the numerator by the denominator: 23 ÷ 4 = 5 . Here, 5 is the quotient, and 3 is the remainder.
 2. Write down 5 as the whole number and the remainder (3) as the new numerator on the same old denominator (4).
 3.  So, 23/4 converted into a mixed fraction will be    3 4 / 5
